# getting_and_cleaning_course_project
Course Project for Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data

All of the code is in one script: run_analysis.R
See CodeBook.md for a detailed explanation of the R script.

The purpose of the code in this repository is to perform the following, as described in the assignment for the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The data is originally from this source at UCI:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The above link contains the data as well as an explanation thereof, including explanations of the experiment, equipment, etc.
